Galaxy name generator - BRIEF

Firstly, I created a button which creates random names to be generated. I initially had it so that it was pre set
names that were paired together to create a full name in order to name the galaxy. However, it didnt meet the 
brief requirement. I then made it so the script grab vowels and consonants from a list of strings and matches them
together to make randomly generated names which are pronounceable.

This both tackles unique strings and obscene words as it's practically impossible to get an obscene word but doesnt 
fully prevent duplicate words.


public class NameGeneratorThing : MonoBehaviour {

    
    public UnityEngine.UI.Text galaxyname;

   public void NameGenerator()
    {
	//Selects a random range between a word within 3-10
        galaxyname.text = GalaxyNames(Random.Range(3,10));
    }
    static string GalaxyNames(int length)
    {
        const string vowels = "aeiou";
        const string consonants = "bcdfghjklmnpqrstvwxyz";

        var rnd = new System.Random();

        length = length % 2 == 0 ? length : length + 1;

        var name = new char[length];

        for (var i = 0; i < length; i += 2)
        {
            name[i] = vowels[rnd.Next(vowels.Length)];
            name[i + 1] = consonants[rnd.Next(consonants.Length)];
        }

        return new string(name);
    }
