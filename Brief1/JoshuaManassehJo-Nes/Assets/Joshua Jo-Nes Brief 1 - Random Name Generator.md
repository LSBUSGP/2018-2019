# Joshua Jo-Nes Brief 1 - Random Name Generator

# Function:

The random name generator script is able to generate a range of pronounceable names. The names generated will have a first name and a surname. The result name will be checked against already generated names to make sure there are no duplicates. All names generated will be added to a public list that can accessed. Names generated will also be checked against obscenities to ensure quality of names and to avoid any offensive words or names being generated.

# Usage:

To impliment the name generator script in a game, all that must be done is add the single script to the game. A public method called "NewName()" can be called. This method will output a random name that can then be use however the user wishes. The user can manually add words or names to the obscenities list for the name generator to check agianst.
